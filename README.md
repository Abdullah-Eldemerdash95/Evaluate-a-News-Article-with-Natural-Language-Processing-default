# Project Instructions

This repo is your starter code for the project. It is the same as the starter code we began with in lesson 2. Install and configure Webpack just as we did in the course. Feel free to refer to the course repo as you build this one, and remember to make frequent commits and to create and merge branches as necessary!

The goal of this project is to give you practice with:
- Setting up Webpack
- Sass styles
- Webpack Loaders and Plugins
- Creating layouts and page design
- Service workers
- Using APIs and creating requests to external urls

On top of that, I want to introduce you to the topic of Natural Language Processing. NLPs leverage machine learning and deep learning create a program that can interpret natural human speech. Systems like Alexa, Google Assistant, and many voice interaction programs are well known to us, but understanding human speech is an incredibly difficult task and requires a lot of resources to achieve. Full disclosure, this is the Wikipedia definition, but I found it to be a clear one:

> Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of computer science, information engineering, and artificial intelligence
concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages, in particular how to program computers to
process and analyze large amounts of natural language data.

You could spend years and get a masters degree focusing on the details of creating NLP systems and algorithms. Typically, NLP programs require far more resources than individuals have access to, but a fairly new API called Aylien has put a public facing API in front of their NLP system. We will use it in this project to determine various attributes of an article or blog post.

## Getting started

It would probably be good to first get your basic project setup and functioning. Follow the steps from the course up to Lesson 4 but don't add Service Workers just yet. We won't need the service workers during development and having extra caches floating around just means there's more potential for confusion. So, fork this repo and begin your project setup.

Remember that once you clone, you will still need to install everything:

`cd` into your new folder and run:
- `npm install`

## Setting up the API

MeaningCloud API:  Once you create an account with MeaningCloud, you will be given a license key to start using the API. This API does not require an SDK.

...but there's a problem with this. We are about to put our personal API keys into a file, but when we push, this file is going to be available PUBLICLY on Github. Private keys, visible publicly are never a good thing. So, we have to figure out a way to make that not happen. The way we will do that is with environment variables. Environment variables are pretty much like normal variables in that they have a name and hold a value, but these variables only belong to your system and won't be visible when you push to a different environment like Github.

- [ ] Use npm or yarn to install the dotenv package ```npm install dotenv```. This will allow us to use environment variables we set in a new file
- [ ] Create a new ```.env``` file in the root of your project
- [ ] Go to your .gitignore file and add ```.env``` - this will make sure that we don't push our environment variables to Github! If you forget this step, all of the work we did to protect our API keys was pointless.
- [ ] Fill the .env file with your API keys like this:
```
API_KEY=**************************
```
- [ ] Add this code to the very top of your server/index.js file:
```
const dotenv = require('dotenv');
dotenv.config();
```
- [ ] Reference variables you created in the .env file by putting ```process.env``` in front of it, an example might look like this:
```
console.log(`Your API key is ${process.env.API_KEY}`);
```
...Not that you would want to do that. This means that our updated API credential settings will look like this:
```javascript


## After the  API

Once you are hooked up to the Aylien API, you are most of the way there! Along with making sure you are following all the requirements in the project rubric in the classroom, here are a few other steps to make sure you take.

- Parse the response body to dynamically fill content on the page.
- Test that the server and form submission work, making sure to also handle error responses if the user input does not match API requirements. 
- Go back to the web pack config and add the setup for service workers.  
- Test that the site is now available even when you stop your local server 

how to run :-
## now we first npm install 
then we # Choose the necessary installation for your development mode
npm i -D @babel/core @babel/preset-env babel-loader
npm i -D style-loader node-sass css-loader sass-loader
npm i -D clean-webpack-plugin
npm i -D html-webpack-plugin
npm i -D mini-css-extract-plugin
npm i -D optimize-css-assets-webpack-plugin terser-webpack-plugin

## we start to edit our modes dev mode i put an port to it plus to 2 scripts one to run and generate files into dist folder and one to open live server on port we selected before but each time we use dev mode we have to make sure that const port = same number in webpack.dev.js port. this one equal 8000
## to start our dev mode we npm run start - npm run build-dev npm run build-watch

## after edit in dev mode and prod mode  i went to edit index .js and html 
-- index.js should have all import for styles and used fns and export these func 
-- in all files in index.html and js files all used js fn we use Client.fnName no import 
-- this cause we make library to connect whole scope togther so we can trigger actions 

## if we want to run prod mode we need to edit port number to choosen port we want like 8001 
and we need to run server too and this by npm run build-prod npm start 

## @jest to using testing method we need to do as instructions
-- install Jest by using npm install --save-dev jest
--Write the custom JS in your src/client/js directory, responsible for the server, and form submission task.
-- In each test file, the general flow of the test block should be:
--Import the js file to test /Define the input for the function. 
--Define the expected output/Check if the function produces the expected output.
--we put a test script "test": "jest"
-- i face a runtime error problem i used that reference to solve it

## Deploying

A great step to take with your finished project would be to deploy it! Unfortunately its a bit out of scope for me to explain too much about how to do that here, but checkout [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) or [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) for some really intuitive free hosting options.
